# jArchive_Scrape
This program is a webscraper that produces CVS files of clues and answers from Jeopardy! from the jArchive website.

The goal of this program create easy to use resource of Jeopardy! clues and answers.

This program is what I will be using to load the jGame web application with trivia questions.
